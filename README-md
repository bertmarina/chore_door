# Choor door game  
  
Page layout designed with HTML and CSS.  
Game logic defined with JS.  
  
The purpose of the game is not to find the ChoreBot behind the first two doors we open. If we do, we lose the game and have to start a new one.  
We can repeat the game many times as we want as we can click on the 'Good luck! / Play again?' button at the end of every game.  
  
Have fun!
